# SmartGreen

Smart watering project for your garden. It uses multiple sensors such as ultrasonic depth measurement of your watering tank, humidity sensors, and online weather forecast.


## Usage/Examples

In this repository you are provided with in-detailed schematics of the PCB-board for diy purposes. In the future you might be able to buy the PCB.

The device is meant to be used with [ESPHOME](https://esphome.io/) installed onto and work in conjunction with [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

The device uses 12VDC power input. There are 5 230V/16A relays installed onto it so you can connect devices up to 230V (could be less). I've used them as switches for garden pumps and electromagnetic valves.

It also has the built in connector for [SR04M](https://www.google.com/search?q=sr04m) ultrasonic sensor i've used to detect the level of water in a tank.
